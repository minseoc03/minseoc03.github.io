## Welcome!

I’m **Minseo Choi**, a sophomore studying **Computer Science and Computer Engineering at Johns Hopkins University**.

I’m deeply interested in **ML Systems**, especially the intersection of **machine learning, compilers, and GPU performance engineering**. Rather than focusing only on model accuracy, I care about how models run in practice — how inference can be faster, cheaper, and more scalable through better systems design.

## What I’m currently working on

My recent work mostly lives in the low-level side of ML systems:

- **LLM Serving & Inference Infrastructure**
Building an LLM-based log analysis agent using frameworks like Ray Serve and vLLM, while studying batching, memory management, and latency–throughput trade-offs in real-world serving systems.

- **GPU Kernel & Performance Engineering**
Implementing core algorithms such as FlashAttention from scratch using CUDA and Triton, to understand memory access patterns, kernel fusion, and performance bottlenecks at a deeper level.

- **ML Compilers & IR Design**
Working through LLVM’s Kaleidoscope tutorial and experimenting with toy compiler pipelines — from parsing and ASTs to IR generation and JIT execution — as a foundation for future ML compiler projects.

- **Applied ML Optimization**
Previously participated in ML competitions and hackathons, where I focused heavily on data imbalance, optimization strategies, and practical model deployment under constraints.

## What I’m aiming for

Long-term, I want to work on:
- ML inference engines,
- GPU-accelerated systems,
- and compiler-driven optimizations that make modern ML models practical at scale.

I’m still early in this journey, but I enjoy being in that phase where there’s always more to learn — and more things to break and fix along the way.
