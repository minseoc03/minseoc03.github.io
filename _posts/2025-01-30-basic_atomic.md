### Atomic Operation

- An **atomic operation** ensures that when many threads simultaneously access the same variable, the accesses are serialized so that race conditions do not occur.  
- For example, suppose there is a variable called `result` that stores the sum of all elements in an array.  
- If multiple threads attempt to update this variable without atomic operations, the order of execution may be interleaved incorrectly, resulting in an inaccurate final value.  
- Atomic operations are also used in other cases such as counters, histograms, and any scenario where multiple threads must update the same variable.  

### Code Example

```cpp
#include <cuda_runtime.h>

// Kernel to sum an array using atomicAdd
__global__ void atomicSumKernel(const float *input, float *result, int N) {
    int idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x;
    
    // Each thread adds its element to the result using atomicAdd
    if (idx < N) {
        atomicAdd(result, input[idx]);
    }
}
```
- By using the atomicAdd() function, threads update the result variable safely, one at a time.

### Drawbacks
- Since atomic operations serialize parallel execution, excessive use can lead to bottlenecks.
- To mitigate this, optimization strategies can be applied:
    - For example, when summing an array, each block can first compute a partial sum using shared memory and then combine results at the end, reducing reliance on atomics.
