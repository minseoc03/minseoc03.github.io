# Postfix Notation

### Example
- Infix: `a + b`  
- Postfix: `ab+`

- Infix: `a + b + c * d + e * f`  
- Postfix: `ab+ cd*+ ef*+`

**How to read:**  
```
((ab+) (cd* )+ (ef* )+)
1. (ab+) → a * b = A
2. (cd*) → c * d = B
3. (A + B) → (a * b) + (c * d) = C
4. (ef*) → e * f = D
5. (C + D) → (a * b + c * d) + (e * f)
```

### Why?

- Computers can calculate expressions simply by scanning **left to right**.  
- Parentheses are no longer needed.

### Algorithm to Convert Infix → Postfix

1. Put `"("` into the stack → because it has the lowest priority.  
2. Read the infix expression from left to right.  
3. If you read an operand → print the operand itself.  
4. If you read an operator → pop all operators in the stack which have higher priority than the current operator, then push the current operator into the stack.  
5. At the end → pop all remaining operators.

### Example Walkthrough

**Infix:**  
```
a + b * c + d
```

Step-by-step process:

| Input (in) | Operator in Stack | Compare | Output (out) |
|------------|-------------------|---------|--------------|
| a          | (                 |         | a            |
| +          | ( +               |         | a            |
| b          | ( +               |         | ab           |
| *          | ( + *             |         | ab           |
| c          | ( + *             |         | abc          |
| +          | ( +               | pop *   | abc*+        |
| d          | ( +               |         | abc*+d       |

**Result:**  
```
Postfix = abc*+d+
```

**Which represents:**  
```
((ab c*) + (d+))
```
