### BNF

- **BNF (Backus Naur Form)** is a notation system for defining the syntax of programming languages.

### Basic Form

- `< >` = syntactic element  
- `::=` = definition  
- `|` = or  

**Examples:**

```
<num> ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9
<alpha> ::= a | b | c | d | ... | x | y | z
<identifier> ::= <alpha> <identifier> <alpha> | <identifier> <num>
```

- This means identifiers should start with an alphabet and then be followed by either numbers or alphabets.  
- Note that `<identifier>` is recursive.

### BNF Tree Example (Korean Sentence)

Production rules:

```
<sent.> ::= <subj.> <pred.>               # Rule 1
<subj.> ::= <noun> <part.>                # Rule 2
<pred.> ::= <verb>                        # Rule 3
<noun> ::= 나 | 너 | 철수                  # Rule 4
<part.> ::= 은 | 는 | 이 | 가             # Rule 5
<verb> ::= 간다 | 공부한다 | 먹는다      # Rule 6
```

Tree expansion:

```
<sent.>
  -> <subj.> <pred.>                        (Rule 1)
  -> <noun> <part.> <pred.>                 (Rule 2)
  -> <noun> <part.> <verb>                  (Rule 3)
  -> 나 <part.> <verb>                      (Rule 4)
  -> 나는 <verb>                            (Rule 5)
  -> 나는 공부한다                          (Rule 6)
```

### Extended Backus Naur Form (EBNF)

- EBNF is an **extended version of BNF** with 4 additional meta-symbols:

1. `[ ]` → can skip (optional)
2. `{ }` → repeat more than 0 times
3. `( )` → grouping
4. `::=` → meta-symbol as non-terminal

**Example:**

```
<identifier> ::= <alpha> { <alpha> | <num> }
```

- This means an identifier starts with an alphabet and can be followed by multiple alphabets or numbers.

**Special Symbols:**

- `ε` = empty  
- `{α}` = repeat more than 0 times  
- Recursive definitions are allowed, e.g.:

```
A ::= {B}
A ::= ε | AB
```
