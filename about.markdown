# About Me

- 🎓 Sophomore @ Johns Hopkins University (CS major, caffeinated & sleep-deprived)  
- ⚡ Compiler hobbyist — LLVM/MLIR rabbit holes are my idea of “fun”  
- 🔬 Machine Learning Systems nerd (yes, I read optimization passes for leisure)  
- 🎮 GPU programming enthusiast — CUDA kernels are my playground  
- 🥁 Drummer — because hitting things in 7/8 time signature is therapeutic  
- 🖥️ Current obsession: building toy ML compilers that barely work but look cool in the terminal

# If longer words are needed...

Hi, I’m Minseo — a computer science undergraduate and an unrepentant tech nerd.  
I spend most of my time tinkering with compilers, GPU programming, and machine learning systems.  
When I’m not buried in code, I’m probably breaking kernels just to squeeze 2% more performance.  
This site is my notebook for projects, experiments, studying, and the occasional rabbit hole I can’t escape from.
